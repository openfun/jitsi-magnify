# Auth flow

The auth flow is made of a few requests, a state manager, and 3 components. A protection of the backend looks like:

```tsx
export default function App() {
  const { user, connexionStatus } = useStore();

  if (connexionStatus === ConnexionStatus.CONNECTING) return <AuthGard />;
  if (connexionStatus === ConnexionStatus.DISCONNECTED) return <AuthForm />;
  return <LayoutWithSidebar>The app as connected user</LayoutWithSidebar>;
}
```

First, the `AuthGard` is responsible to try to run a request (to get the user) and so to refresh the token if needed, when in memory the user is not identified yet.

Then, the `AuthForm` is responsible to display the form to connect the user. It is shown only, if th

Finally, the `LayoutWithSidebar` is responsible to display the app as connected user.

# The log controller implementation

The log controller must allow to work as if the user had a valid refresh token or not. This is controlled by the attribute `controller.refreshTokenActivated`.

For instance, this storybook provides a checkbox that allow to switch this parametter, and save this setting in the localStorage.

To use the log controller in the d√©mo app and to test the two behaviours, you can use the following code:

```tsx
const controller = new LogController();
controller.refreshTokenActivated = false // or true

<ControllerProvider controller={controller}>
    <App />
</ControllerProvider>
```

- if refreshTokenActivated, all refresh token requests will succeed
- if not, all refresh token requests will fail

## Trace if refresh token works

- **Display a loader**
- _Set status to CONNECTING_
- `getMyProfile`: fails
- `refresh`: Ok
- _Set status to CONNECTED_
- **Display the page**
- `getMyProfile`: Ok
- Other requests

## Trace if refresh fails

- **Display a loader**
- _Set status to CONNECTING_
- `getMyProfile`: fails
- `refresh`: fails
- _Set status to DISCONNECTED_
- **Display the auth forms**
- User logins
